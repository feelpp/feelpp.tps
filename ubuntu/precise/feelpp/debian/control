Description: A library for the finite element method
 Provides the dynamic Feel++ libraries.
 .
 Feel++ is a versatile finite element library to solve partial
 differential equations.
 .
 Support 1D, 2D, 3D
 .
 Support the following basic entities: simplices (segment, triangle,
 tetrahedron) and product of simplices (quadrangle, hexahedron)
 .
 Support various point sets on these basic entities: equispaced
 points, quadrature points, interpolation points (Gauss-Lobatto,
 Fekete, WarpBlend?)
 .
 Support continuous and discontinuous Galerkin methods
 .
 Support various polynomial sets:
 .
  * Lagrange(continuous,discontinuous,all dimensions,all interpolation
 point sets)
 .
  * Dubiner(discontinuous), boundary adapted(continuous)
 .
  * Legendre(discontinuous), boundary adapted(continuous)
 .
 Provide mathematical concept for higher order abstraction (Function
 spaces and associated elements, forms and operators)
 .
 Provide a language embedded in C++ for variational formulations,
 projection and numerical integration
